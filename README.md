# Donation Inventory Manager - Phase 1

## Description
This C++ application manages a list of donated items for a non-profit organization. It currently supports item creation, printing, and comparison. Future phases will support full inventory management and user interfaces.

## Resources Used
- Basic google searches for syntax
- Chat GPT to right this README
- C++ documentation at [cplusplus.com](http://cplusplus.com)
- StackOverflow discussions on operator overloading

## Summary
### What Went Well:
- Successfully implemented object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns.
- Operator overloading worked as expected during test cases.

### What Could Be Improved:
- Planning more advanced inventory features earlier might help align future requirements better.
- A GUI or text-menu interface could improve usability in future phases.

### Challenges:
- Deciding what fields to include for a donation item was initially unclear until the use case (non-profit donations) was solidified.
- Remembering exact syntax for operator overloading required review.

### Next Steps (Phase 2):
- Create an `Inventory` class to manage multiple `DonatedItem` objects.
- Add file I/O for saving and loading donation lists.
- Integrate simple console-based UI or menu.
